# overview

*note to Corinne*: check out my wiki. Let's try and agree on an overall learning pathway, that way we'll be able to work on the same things at the same times.

This repo will consist of programs, shell scripts, and general trivia that I collect as I teach myself to become an expert programmer. Books, guides, and interesting pdf's will be in the `literature` directory.

## wiki
The Github wiki tab will outline the broad roadmap of my journey. It will be updated as I make progress.

## projects
The Github projects tab will track individual projects that I pursue in order to learn specific skills. Some of these projects will also be described below, in the `programs` section, if they are programs.

## programs
The following section will consist of the individual programs that I build. Although these might function better as individual repos, that might clutter things.
