# learn-everything
## overview
This repo will consist of programs, shell scripts, and general trivia that I collect as I teach myself to become an expert programmer. Books, guides, and interesting pdf's will be in the `literature` directory.

### wiki
The Github wiki tab will outline the broad roadmap of my journey. It will be updated as I make progress.

### projects
The Github projects tab will track individual projects that I pursue in order to learn specific skills. Some of these projects will also be described below, in the `programs` section, if they are programs.

### programs
The following section will consist of the individual programs that I build. Although these might function better as individual repos, that might clutter things.
